# Google-KickStart2020
My solutions for the Kick Start 2020 in Python 3

My goal of this year it to share my solutions of the Kick Start 2020, so more people can improve their skills
I use Python because I think Python is easier to understand that other languages and because you code less lines
It is not the fastest language, but its fast enough to pass the time limit in the contests
