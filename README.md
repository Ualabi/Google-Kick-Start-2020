# Google-KickStart2020
My solutions for the Kick Start 2020 in Python 3, Pypy2 or C++

My goal of this year it to share my solutions of the Kick Start 2020, so more people can improve their skills.
I prefer Python because I think it is easier to understand that other languages and because you code less lines, it is not the fastest language, but its fast enough to pass most of the time limit in the problems, if its not, Pypy2 helps to pass it
